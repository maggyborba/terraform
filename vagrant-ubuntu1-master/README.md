# Basic Ubuntu 18.04 setup with ZShell 

## Objectives
The objective of this vagrant file is to spin up and provision a VirtualBox VM with the following especifications (USING SHELL SCRIPTS EMBEDDED IN THE VAGRANTFILE):

- OS: ubuntu-18.04
- Private IP: 10.0.0.3
- Shell: ZShell + Oh My SZh (only for fun)
- Basic Packages: GIT, Zsh, Docker

## Requirements

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

## Advantages
The main advantage of using vagrant for this kind of testing environment is that it's blazing fast to deploy.  

The addition of Zshell gives a new look to your terminal. The use of [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) makes it really fun to use while adding some interesting visual features (especially when using GIT every day!)
